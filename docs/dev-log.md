## 2024-07-28: Authentication Research (Simulated)

This entry outlines the typical process for investigating web/app authentication and hypothesizes potential schemes for Suno AI. This is a simulated research phase before actual implementation.

### Typical Investigation Process

When investigating how a web application like Suno AI handles authentication, the following steps are typically taken:

1.  **Browser DevTools (Network Tab):**
    *   Open browser DevTools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools).
    *   Navigate to `https://suno.ai/` and monitor the Network tab during the login process.
    *   Filter for XHR/Fetch requests.
    *   Inspect request headers (e.g., `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `X-CSRF-Token`), response headers (e.g., `Set-Cookie`), and request/response payloads for authentication-related information.

2.  **Inspect JavaScript:**
    *   Search the loaded JavaScript files (Sources tab in DevTools) for keywords like `auth`, `login`, `token`, `cookie`, `API_KEY`, `SESSION_ID` to understand how authentication is handled client-side.

3.  **Traffic Inspection Tools (for Mobile/Desktop Apps if applicable):**
    *   If Suno AI has a mobile or desktop application and direct API access isn't clear from the web app, tools like Fiddler, Charles Proxy, or mitmproxy can be used.
    *   This involves configuring the device/emulator to route traffic through the proxy to inspect HTTPS requests and responses.

4.  **Token Refresh Mechanisms:**
    *   Observe if and how access tokens are refreshed. This might involve specific API calls or be handled transparently by client-side code. Identify the triggers for token refresh (e.g., token expiry, specific API responses).

### Hypothesized Authentication Schemes for Suno AI

Based on common web application patterns, Suno AI might use one or a combination of the following:

1.  **Cookie-Based Sessions:**
    *   **Mechanism:** After a successful login (e.g., POST to `/api/login` with email/password), the server sets an HTTP-only session cookie (e.g., `sessionid`). This cookie is automatically sent by the browser with subsequent requests to the Suno AI domain.
    *   **CSRF Protection:** POST, PUT, DELETE requests might require a CSRF token (e.g., `csrftoken`), often set as another cookie and included in a request header (e.g., `X-CSRFToken`) or form data.

2.  **Token-Based (JWT/OAuth-like):**
    *   **Mechanism:** After login, the server returns an access token (e.g., a JSON Web Token - JWT) and possibly a refresh token in the response body.
    *   **Usage:** The access token is then sent in the `Authorization` header of subsequent API requests (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`).
    *   **Refresh:** When the access token expires, the refresh token is used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.

3.  **Mobile-Specific Device Tokens / API Keys:**
    *   **Mechanism:** If primarily interacting via a mobile app, there might be device-specific authentication tokens or static API keys embedded (less likely for a service like this but possible). These might be passed via custom headers.
    *   *(Note: This is less likely to be the primary web authentication method but could be an auxiliary one or for specific client types).*

### Key Information to Look For During Actual Investigation

*   **Login URL:** The specific endpoint for submitting credentials (e.g., `/api/auth/login`, `/api/v1/login`, `https://auth.suno.ai/login`).
*   **Token Refresh URL:** The endpoint to refresh an expired access token (if applicable).
*   **Logout URL:** The endpoint to invalidate the session/token.
*   **HTTP Methods:** Methods used for auth operations (e.g., POST for login/logout, GET for user info).
*   **Request Payload Structure (Login):** The JSON or form data structure for login (e.g., `{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "securepassword123"}` or `{"identity": "...", "password": "..."}`).
*   **Token/Cookie Location:**
    *   **Cookies:** Names of session cookies (`connect.sid`, `session_id`, etc.), CSRF cookies.
    *   **Tokens:** How tokens are returned in login response (e.g., JSON body: `{"accessToken": "...", "refreshToken": "..."}`) and how they are sent in subsequent requests (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
*   **API Base URL:** The root URL for authenticated API calls (e.g., `https://api.suno.ai/v1/`).

### Actual Findings (To Be Filled In After Manual Investigation)

*(Placeholder for concrete details discovered through manual DevTools investigation, such as specific URLs, token names, header names, and payload structures. This section will be updated once the real Suno AI authentication flow is analyzed.)*

*   **Login Endpoint:**
*   **Method:**
*   **Request Payload:**
*   **Response (Success - relevant parts):**
*   **Cookie(s) Set:**
*   **Token(s) Issued (if any):**
*   **Token Refresh Endpoint (if any):**
*   **Key Headers for Authenticated Requests:**

### Next Steps

Based on these typical patterns and hypotheses, the next steps will involve:

1.  **Simulated Implementation:** Begin implementing client-side functions in `utils/sunoApi.ts` to handle:
    *   Login with email and password.
    *   Storing session information (cookies or tokens).
    *   Making authenticated requests.
    *   Handling potential token refresh.
2.  **Verification & Adjustment:** Once the actual Suno AI authentication details are investigated (by manually using DevTools on `suno.ai`), the implemented functions will be verified and adjusted to match the real API behavior. This includes updating URLs, request/response parsing, and header management.
3.  **Credential Management:** Ensure that sensitive information like passwords and tokens are handled securely and align with n8n's credential system.

This structured approach allows for progress in development while anticipating the need for adaptation once concrete details are available from the manual investigation phase.

## 2024-07-29: Initial Project Context & SDLC Analysis

This entry analyzes the current state of the `n8n-nodes-suno-ai` project to understand its context within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

*   **Project Name:** n8n-nodes-suno-ai (derived from `package.json`)
*   **Stated Purpose:** "custom n8n node for interacting with the Suno AI music generation service" (from `README.md`).
*   **Version:** 0.1.0 (from `package.json`).

*   **SDLC Stage Inference:**
    *   The version `0.1.0` and the `README.md` statement "This node is currently **under development**" strongly suggest the project is in an **early development phase** or **initial implementation stage**.
    *   It is likely pre-MVP (Minimum Viable Product) or in the process of building towards an initial MVP. The current focus on scaffolding, mock implementations, and foundational structure (like this analysis) supports this.

*   **Development Methodology Clues:**
    *   **Structured TypeScript Development:** The presence of `package.json` with scripts for `lint` (ESLint), `format` (Prettier), `build` (TypeScript Compiler `tsc`), and `dev` (using `tsc --watch`) indicates a modern, structured approach to TypeScript development.
    *   **Code Quality Focus:** The explicit use of ESLint and Prettier from the outset suggests a commitment to code quality, consistency, and maintainability.
    *   **Build System:** `gulpfile.js` is present, and the `package.json` build script includes `gulp build:icons`, indicating Gulp is used for specific build tasks, likely related to n8n node assets.
    *   **NPM Publishing Awareness:** The `prepublishOnly` script in `package.json` shows an understanding of the npm package publishing lifecycle, even at this early stage.
    *   **n8n Custom Node Structure:** The directory structure (`nodes`, `credentials`, `interfaces`, `utils`, `tests`) is conventional for n8n custom node development and was established through the initial project setup and subsequent scaffolding tasks.
    *   **Iterative Refinement:** The current request for a "Senior Software Engineer" review and refactoring (which this series of tasks represents) indicates a phase where the project is focusing on solidifying its architectural foundation and code quality before expanding features or considering a public release. This iterative refinement is a good sign.

*   **CI/CD:**
    *   No dedicated CI/CD configuration files (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`) were found in the root directory during `ls()` checks.
    *   This suggests that a formal, automated CI/CD pipeline is likely not yet implemented. Given the early stage, this is not unusual, but it would be a key area for future improvement to automate testing, building, and potentially publishing.

*   **Overall Maturity:**
    *   The project is clearly in its **infancy** but is being established with sound software engineering practices (TypeScript, linting, formatting, structured layout).
    *   The current set of activities (scaffolding, mock API implementation, test structure creation, and this analysis) is aimed at building a robust foundation for future development and feature implementation.
    *   The focus is on getting the "skeleton" right before adding significant "flesh" to it.
    *   Key next steps from an SDLC perspective would involve:
        1.  Actual API integration (moving from mock to real).
        2.  More comprehensive unit and integration testing.
        3.  Setting up a CI/CD pipeline.
        4.  User/developer documentation beyond the basic README.
        5.  Gathering feedback if an early version is shared.

## 2024-07-29: Functional Architecture & Structure Audit - Initial Pass

This entry provides an initial audit of the project's functional architecture and code structure.

*   **Overall Directory Structure:**
    *   `.vscode/`: Editor configuration (e.g., `extensions.json`). Standard.
    *   `credentials/`: Contains n8n credential types.
        *   `SunoApi.credentials.ts`: Defines fields for Suno authentication (email/password).
        *   `HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`: Appears to be a leftover example credential, potentially unused. **(Action Item: Verify and remove if unused)**.
    *   `docs/`: Project documentation.
        *   `dev-log.md`: This development log.
    *   `interfaces/`: TypeScript type definitions.
        *   `SunoTypes.ts`: Currently populated with `SunoTrack`, `SunoJob`, `SunoAuthResponse`, `SunoPromptOptions`. This is good.
        *   `README.md`: Placeholder.
    *   `nodes/`: Contains n8n node implementations.
        *   `Suno/`: Specific directory for the Suno integration.
            *   `Suno.node.ts`: Implements the main operational logic for interacting with Suno (generate, status, download, etc.).
            *   `SunoTrigger.node.ts`: Implements trigger logic for Suno events (e.g., track completion).
            *   `suno.svg`: Icon for the Suno node.
        *   `README.md`: Placeholder.
    *   `tests/`: Test files.
        *   `checkEndpoints.ts`: Script for basic (currently mocked) API endpoint checks.
        *   `README.md`: Placeholder.
    *   `utils/`: Utility scripts and modules.
        *   `sunoApi.ts`: Core module for encapsulating all (currently mocked) API calls to Suno. Handles authentication token management internally.
        *   `README.md`: Placeholder.
    *   Root files: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc.js`, `gulpfile.js`, `index.js` (empty), `README.md`, etc. define the project, build process, and standards.

*   **Core Modules & Responsibilities (Initial Thoughts):**
    *   **`SunoApi.credentials.ts` (Credentials Module):**
        *   Interface: Defines how n8n collects and stores Suno credentials (email, password).
        *   Processing: Securely provides these credentials to other parts of the node when required.
        *   Output: Credential data for authentication.
    *   **`utils/sunoApi.ts` (API Interaction Module):**
        *   Interface: Exports functions for specific Suno actions (login, submitPrompt, pollJobStatus, etc.).
        *   Processing:
            *   Manages authentication state (stores/retrieves a session token - currently mocked).
            *   Constructs and (will construct) actual API requests.
            *   Parses responses and (will parse) actual API responses.
            *   Handles API-level errors.
        *   Output: Data from Suno API (e.g., job status, track info, audio buffer - currently mocked) or throws errors.
        *   *This is the primary candidate for Domain-Driven Design's "Service" or "Repository" pattern for the Suno external system.*
    *   **`nodes/Suno/Suno.node.ts` (n8n Action Node Module):**
        *   Interface: Defines node properties (UI in n8n) for different operations.
        *   Processing:
            *   Takes user input from n8n.
            *   Uses `utils/sunoApi.ts` to perform actions based on the selected operation.
            *   Formats results for n8n output, including binary data handling.
        *   Output: JSON data or binary data to the n8n workflow.
    *   **`nodes/Suno/SunoTrigger.node.ts` (n8n Trigger Node Module):**
        *   Interface: Defines trigger properties (UI in n8n).
        *   Processing:
            *   Manages polling schedule (using n8n's `manualTriggerFunction`).
            *   Uses `utils/sunoApi.ts` to check for events (track completion, new songs).
            *   (Will need state management to avoid duplicate triggers for "New Song Available").
        *   Output: Emits data to start n8n workflows.
    *   **`interfaces/SunoTypes.ts` (Data Transfer Objects Module):**
        *   Interface: Defines TypeScript types for data exchanged with the Suno API and within the node.
        *   *This is crucial for type safety and clarity. It has been populated, which is a positive step.*

*   **Key Data Flows (Example - Generate Song):**
    1.  User configures "Suno" node in n8n UI for "Generate Song from Prompt", enters prompt.
    2.  `Suno.node.ts` (`execute` method for 'generateSongFromPrompt'):
        *   Retrieves prompt parameter.
        *   Retrieves credentials via `this.getCredentials('sunoApi')`.
        *   Calls `sunoApi.loginWithCredentials(email, password)` (implicitly done as `sunoApi.ts` handles token persistence after initial login, or explicitly if the node's "login" operation is used first by the user).
        *   Calls `sunoApi.submitPrompt(promptText)`.
    3.  `utils/sunoApi.ts` (`submitPrompt` function):
        *   Checks `isAuthenticated()`.
        *   (Future: Constructs actual HTTP request to Suno API with prompt and auth token).
        *   (Future: Receives response, e.g., a job ID).
        *   Returns mocked `SunoJob` object.
    4.  `Suno.node.ts`:
        *   Receives `SunoJob` object.
        *   Formats it using `this.helpers.returnJsonArray()`.
        *   Returns data to n8n workflow.

*   **Initial Architectural Observations:**
    *   The separation of concerns between node logic (`Suno.node.ts`), API interaction (`sunoApi.ts`), and credential definition (`SunoApi.credentials.ts`) is good and follows n8n best practices.
    *   The use of a utility module (`sunoApi.ts`) for all external communication is a key architectural strength, centralizing where API knowledge resides.
    *   The population of `SunoTypes.ts` for typed data exchange is a positive development.
    *   `index.js` being empty is fine as `package.json` handles node/credential registration.
    *   The `HttpBinApi.credentials.ts` file seems out of place for a Suno-specific node and should be reviewed for removal.
    *   The `tests/checkEndpoints.ts` provides a good starting point for functional/integration testing of the API utility module, even with mocked endpoints.
    *   State management for triggers (e.g., to prevent duplicate "New Song Available" events) is noted as a future consideration for `SunoTrigger.node.ts`.

## 2024-07-29: Code Quality & Style - Initial Review

This entry provides an initial review of the project's code quality and style, based on the current state of the codebase.

*   **Overall Style and Formatting:**
    *   The codebase uses TypeScript, promoting type safety.
    *   The presence of `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc.js` (and associated scripts in `package.json`) confirms that ESLint and Prettier are configured for linting and formatting. This is crucial for maintaining a consistent codebase.
    *   Visual inspection of files like `Suno.node.ts`, `sunoApi.ts`, etc., shows generally consistent formatting, likely due to Prettier's enforcement.
    *   Type assertions using `as` (e.g., `this.getNodeParameter('prompt', 0, '') as string`) are used, which is common in n8n nodes for parameter retrieval. While acceptable, minimizing their use by ensuring default values and parameter types are well-defined can enhance type safety.

*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   Class names (`SunoNode`, `SunoTrigger`, `SunoApi`) consistently use PascalCase.
    *   Method names (`generateSongFromPrompt`, `pollJobStatus`, `loginWithCredentials`) use camelCase.
    *   Variable names (`activeSessionToken`, `mockJobs`) also follow camelCase.
    *   Node property names (`prompt`, `trackId`, `pollingInterval`, `triggerEvent`) are descriptive and use camelCase.
    *   Overall, naming conventions are clear, descriptive, and adhere to common JavaScript/TypeScript standards.

*   **Comments and JSDoc:**
    *   **`utils/sunoApi.ts`**: Exhibits good JSDoc coverage for exported functions, detailing their purpose, parameters, and return types, and noting their mocked nature.
    *   **`nodes/Suno/Suno.node.ts`**: Contains JSDoc for individual operation methods and a well-structured `description` object for the node's UI.
    *   **`nodes/Suno/SunoTrigger.node.ts`**: Has JSDoc for `trigger` and `manualTrigger` methods, and a well-structured `description` object.
    *   **`credentials/SunoApi.credentials.ts`**: Includes comments explaining the rationale for omitting `authenticate` and `test` blocks during the mock phase.
    *   **`interfaces/SunoTypes.ts`**: This file is currently **empty**, as confirmed by the latest `read_files` check. If it were populated, JSDoc for each type and property would be expected. This is a significant gap to be addressed.
    *   **Inline Comments:** `// TODO:` comments are appropriately used to mark areas needing future implementation or review.
    *   **Console Logging:** Extensive use of `console.log`, `console.error`, and `console.warn` is present, especially in `utils/sunoApi.ts` and `SunoTrigger.node.ts`. While beneficial for debugging mocked behavior, these should be replaced with a more robust logging strategy (e.g., conditional logging or a dedicated logger) or removed when transitioning to actual API calls.

*   **Code Structure & Potential Smells (Initial Observations):**
    *   **Error Handling:** Node operation methods (`Suno.node.ts`) and trigger methods (`SunoTrigger.node.ts`) consistently use `try...catch` blocks and rethrow errors as `NodeOperationError`, which is standard n8n practice. The API utility functions in `sunoApi.ts` also correctly throw errors (e.g., for authentication failures).
    *   **Method Length:** Functions are generally concise. The `execute` method in `Suno.node.ts` uses a clear `switch` statement. The node `properties` array in `Suno.node.ts` and `SunoTrigger.node.ts` is lengthy, but this is typical and necessary for defining the n8n node UI.
    *   **Duplication:** No significant code duplication is apparent in the reviewed core files.
    *   **`interfaces/SunoTypes.ts` Emptiness:** The fact that `interfaces/SunoTypes.ts` is empty is a major gap. Defining data structures is crucial for type safety and for a clear understanding of the data being passed around, especially before implementing actual API calls. **(Action Item: Populate `interfaces/SunoTypes.ts` as a high priority)**.
    *   **Mocking Logic:** The code in `utils/sunoApi.ts` is explicitly designed for mocking, with in-memory stores (`activeSessionToken`, `mockJobs`). This is suitable for the current development phase but will need complete replacement for actual API integration. JSDoc and comments clearly state this.

*   **Linting/Formatting Tools:**
    *   `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc.js` are present.
    *   `package.json` includes scripts: `"format": "prettier nodes credentials --write"`, `"lint": "eslint nodes credentials package.json"`, `"lintfix": "eslint nodes credentials package.json --fix"`.
    *   These demonstrate that the project is well-equipped to enforce code style and catch potential issues automatically.

*   **Summary:**
    *   The project leverages TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier effectively, establishing a good foundation for code quality.
    *   Naming conventions and general code structure are sound.
    *   JSDoc usage is generally good, though it needs to be applied to `interfaces/SunoTypes.ts` once populated.
    *   The primary immediate concerns are the **empty `interfaces/SunoTypes.ts` file** and the pervasive `console.log` statements that will need refinement before any production-level code or real API integration.
    *   The current mocked nature of `utils/sunoApi.ts` is well-documented and appropriate for this stage.

## 2024-07-29: Populated Core Type Definitions

The file `interfaces/SunoTypes.ts` has been populated with essential TypeScript interfaces: `SunoAuthResponse`, `SunoJob`, `SunoTrack`, and `SunoPromptOptions`. These definitions include JSDoc comments for each interface and its properties, aiming to provide clarity and type safety for data exchange related to the Suno API. This addresses a key action item from the "Code Quality & Style - Initial Review".

## 2024-07-29: Dependency Analysis

This entry details the project's dependencies as listed in `package.json`.

*   **Production Dependencies:**
    *   The `package.json` does not list any explicit production `dependencies`. This is typical for n8n nodes where `n8n-workflow` (and `n8n-core`) are treated as peer dependencies.

*   **Peer Dependencies:**
    *   `n8n-workflow`: `*` (This signifies that the node expects n8n's workflow capabilities to be provided by the host n8n environment, which is the standard operational model for custom nodes.)

*   **Development Dependencies (`devDependencies`):**
    *   `@typescript-eslint/parser`: `~8.32.0` (Parser that allows ESLint to lint TypeScript code.)
    *   `eslint`: `^8.57.0` (Core ESLint library for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript.)
    *   `eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`: `^1.16.3` (An n8n-specific ESLint plugin containing recommended rules for n8n node development.)
    *   `gulp`: `^5.0.0` (A toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in development workflow; here, likely for icon management.)
    *   `prettier`: `^3.5.3` (An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style.)
    *   `typescript`: `^5.8.2` (The TypeScript language compiler and language service.)

*   **Node Engine:**
    *   `node`: `>=20.15` (Specifies the minimum Node.js version required to run this project. This is a relatively recent LTS version of Node.js.)

*   **Observations:**
    *   The project utilizes a standard and modern toolset for TypeScript-based development, including robust linting and formatting tools.
    *   Gulp's presence is noted for specific build tasks, as seen in the `build` script (`tsc && gulp build:icons`), likely related to n8n's requirements for node icons.
    *   The specified versions for development dependencies are relatively up-to-date.
    *   A comprehensive audit for outdated versions or security vulnerabilities would necessitate checking these versions against external databases (e.g., npmjs.com, Snyk, Dependabot alerts if configured). However, the listed versions provide the baseline for such a check.
    *   The lack of direct production dependencies is standard for n8n community nodes, as they operate within the n8n execution environment.

## 2024-07-29: FSM Analysis - Preliminary Check

This entry conducts a preliminary check for potential Finite State Machines (FSMs) within the current system design.

*   **Potential FSM Candidates:**
    *   **1. Song Generation Job Lifecycle (within `utils/sunoApi.ts` and observed by `Suno.node.ts` and `SunoTrigger.node.ts`):**
        *   **Description:** The process of generating a song, from prompt submission to track availability, is inherently stateful. The `utils/sunoApi.ts` (mocked implementation) already simulates this with `SunoJob` states.
        *   **Identified States (from `SunoJob` type and `pollJobStatus` mock logic):**
            *   `queued` (Initial state after `submitPrompt`)
            *   `generating` / `processing` (Intermediate state during generation - `processing` is in `SunoJob` type, `generating` is used in mock logic)
            *   `complete` (Final success state, `trackId` becomes available)
            *   `failed` (Final error state)
        *   **Key Events/Triggers for Transitions:**
            *   `submitPrompt()` -> `queued`
            *   Internal Suno AI processing (simulated by polling) -> `generating`/`processing`
            *   Generation success (simulated by polling) -> `complete`
            *   Generation error / invalid input (simulated by polling for non-existent job) -> `failed`
        *   **Relevance:** Modeling this as an FSM is beneficial for:
            *   Clearly defining the expected lifecycle of a generation job.
            *   Handling timeouts or retries at specific stages (e.g., if stuck in `generating` for too long).
            *   Providing more granular status updates to the user via the n8n node.
            *   The `pollJobStatus` function in `sunoApi.ts` queries and drives the (mocked) state of this FSM. The `SunoTrigger.node.ts` for 'Track Generation Complete' also monitors this.

    *   **2. Trigger State Management for "New Song Available" (within `SunoTrigger.node.ts`):**
        *   **Description:** The current mock trigger for "New Song Available" simply emits the first song from the `listPreviousSongs()` call. A robust implementation needs to identify *genuinely new* songs. This implies the trigger itself needs to maintain a state (e.g., a list of song IDs seen in the previous poll).
        *   **Identified States (conceptual):**
            *   `Polling` (Actively checking for new songs)
            *   `Idle` (Between polls - managed by n8n scheduler)
            *   `ProcessingDiff` (After fetching songs, comparing to previous list)
            *   `EmittingNew` (When new songs are found and being emitted)
        *   **Key Events/Triggers for Transitions:**
            *   Poll interval elapses (n8n calls `manualTrigger`) -> `Polling`
            *   `listPreviousSongs()` returns -> `ProcessingDiff`
            *   New songs identified -> `EmittingNew`
            *   Emission complete -> `Idle` (until next poll)
        *   **Relevance:** While perhaps not a classical FSM in the same way as a job lifecycle, thinking about the trigger's polling cycle in terms of states can help design a more reliable mechanism for detecting new items and managing its own operational state (e.g., last polled timestamp, list of seen IDs). This is less about the Suno API's state and more about the trigger node's internal logic.

*   **Next Steps for FSM (if pursued):**
    *   For the "Song Generation Job Lifecycle", if the actual Suno API provides clear state indicators, formalizing the FSM in documentation (e.g., using PlantUML or a state table) would be valuable for the `sunoApi.ts` implementation when moving away from mocks.
    *   For the "New Song Available" trigger, the stateful logic for diffing song lists needs careful design. This might not require a full FSM diagram but rather clear state management variables and logic within the trigger code.

*   **Current Implementation:**
    *   The mocked `utils/sunoApi.ts` already implements a simplified version of the "Song Generation Job Lifecycle" FSM through the `status` property of `SunoJob` and the logic in `pollJobStatus`.
    *   The `SunoTrigger.node.ts` for "New Song Available" currently lacks robust state management for detecting new songs, as noted in its mock implementation.

## 2024-07-29: Defined Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

Created `docs/enhancement_requirements.md` and populated it with detailed Functional Requirements (FRs) based on current node capabilities (authentication, music generation, job/track management, triggers) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) covering Reliability, Maintainability, Usability, Performance, Testability, and Security. This document will serve as a basis for guiding further development and roadmap creation.

## 2024-07-29: Proposed Initial Enhancement Roadmap

Created `docs/enhancement_roadmap.md` outlining a 5-milestone plan: 1. Solidify Mock Implementation, 2. Real API Auth & Read Ops, 3. Real API Core Generation, 4. Real API Triggers & Advanced Features, 5. Refinement & Release Prep. This roadmap will guide iterative development. Key immediate tasks for Milestone 1 include addressing `HttpBinApi.credentials.ts` and `console.log` usage.
