## 2024-07-28: Authentication Research (Simulated)

This entry outlines the typical process for investigating web/app authentication and hypothesizes potential schemes for Suno AI. This is a simulated research phase before actual implementation.

### Typical Investigation Process

When investigating how a web application like Suno AI handles authentication, the following steps are typically taken:

1.  **Browser DevTools (Network Tab):**
    *   Open browser DevTools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools).
    *   Navigate to `https://suno.ai/` and monitor the Network tab during the login process.
    *   Filter for XHR/Fetch requests.
    *   Inspect request headers (e.g., `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `X-CSRF-Token`), response headers (e.g., `Set-Cookie`), and request/response payloads for authentication-related information.

2.  **Inspect JavaScript:**
    *   Search the loaded JavaScript files (Sources tab in DevTools) for keywords like `auth`, `login`, `token`, `cookie`, `API_KEY`, `SESSION_ID` to understand how authentication is handled client-side.

3.  **Traffic Inspection Tools (for Mobile/Desktop Apps if applicable):**
    *   If Suno AI has a mobile or desktop application and direct API access isn't clear from the web app, tools like Fiddler, Charles Proxy, or mitmproxy can be used.
    *   This involves configuring the device/emulator to route traffic through the proxy to inspect HTTPS requests and responses.

4.  **Token Refresh Mechanisms:**
    *   Observe if and how access tokens are refreshed. This might involve specific API calls or be handled transparently by client-side code. Identify the triggers for token refresh (e.g., token expiry, specific API responses).

### Hypothesized Authentication Schemes for Suno AI

Based on common web application patterns, Suno AI might use one or a combination of the following:

1.  **Cookie-Based Sessions:**
    *   **Mechanism:** After a successful login (e.g., POST to `/api/login` with email/password), the server sets an HTTP-only session cookie (e.g., `sessionid`). This cookie is automatically sent by the browser with subsequent requests to the Suno AI domain.
    *   **CSRF Protection:** POST, PUT, DELETE requests might require a CSRF token (e.g., `csrftoken`), often set as another cookie and included in a request header (e.g., `X-CSRFToken`) or form data.

2.  **Token-Based (JWT/OAuth-like):**
    *   **Mechanism:** After login, the server returns an access token (e.g., a JSON Web Token - JWT) and possibly a refresh token in the response body.
    *   **Usage:** The access token is then sent in the `Authorization` header of subsequent API requests (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`).
    *   **Refresh:** When the access token expires, the refresh token is used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.

3.  **Mobile-Specific Device Tokens / API Keys:**
    *   **Mechanism:** If primarily interacting via a mobile app, there might be device-specific authentication tokens or static API keys embedded (less likely for a service like this but possible). These might be passed via custom headers.
    *   *(Note: This is less likely to be the primary web authentication method but could be an auxiliary one or for specific client types).*

### Key Information to Look For During Actual Investigation

*   **Login URL:** The specific endpoint for submitting credentials (e.g., `/api/auth/login`, `/api/v1/login`, `https://auth.suno.ai/login`).
*   **Token Refresh URL:** The endpoint to refresh an expired access token (if applicable).
*   **Logout URL:** The endpoint to invalidate the session/token.
*   **HTTP Methods:** Methods used for auth operations (e.g., POST for login/logout, GET for user info).
*   **Request Payload Structure (Login):** The JSON or form data structure for login (e.g., `{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "securepassword123"}` or `{"identity": "...", "password": "..."}`).
*   **Token/Cookie Location:**
    *   **Cookies:** Names of session cookies (`connect.sid`, `session_id`, etc.), CSRF cookies.
    *   **Tokens:** How tokens are returned in login response (e.g., JSON body: `{"accessToken": "...", "refreshToken": "..."}`) and how they are sent in subsequent requests (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
*   **API Base URL:** The root URL for authenticated API calls (e.g., `https://api.suno.ai/v1/`).

### Actual Findings (To Be Filled In After Manual Investigation)

*(Placeholder for concrete details discovered through manual DevTools investigation, such as specific URLs, token names, header names, and payload structures. This section will be updated once the real Suno AI authentication flow is analyzed.)*

*   **Login Endpoint:**
*   **Method:**
*   **Request Payload:**
*   **Response (Success - relevant parts):**
*   **Cookie(s) Set:**
*   **Token(s) Issued (if any):**
*   **Token Refresh Endpoint (if any):**
*   **Key Headers for Authenticated Requests:**

### Next Steps

Based on these typical patterns and hypotheses, the next steps will involve:

1.  **Simulated Implementation:** Begin implementing client-side functions in `utils/sunoApi.ts` to handle:
    *   Login with email and password.
    *   Storing session information (cookies or tokens).
    *   Making authenticated requests.
    *   Handling potential token refresh.
2.  **Verification & Adjustment:** Once the actual Suno AI authentication details are investigated (by manually using DevTools on `suno.ai`), the implemented functions will be verified and adjusted to match the real API behavior. This includes updating URLs, request/response parsing, and header management.
3.  **Credential Management:** Ensure that sensitive information like passwords and tokens are handled securely and align with n8n's credential system.

This structured approach allows for progress in development while anticipating the need for adaptation once concrete details are available from the manual investigation phase.
